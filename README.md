# 🚀 About Me

Hello! 👋 My name is Nikita, and I'm 20 years old. I'm a true enthusiast in the world of programming, and I'm devoted to the Java programming language like an artist to their masterpiece. ☕

🏡 I was born in the cozy city of Kharkiv, Ukraine 🇺🇦, but now my life is intertwined with Poland 🇵🇱, where I am actively pursuing my programming journey.

## 💻 What I Do

My passion lies in web development, where I create digital masterpieces with elements of art. My toolkit includes:

- 🌐 HTML for shaping content structure.
- 🎨 CSS for adding style and elegance.
- 💡 JavaScript for crafting interactivity and dynamism.
- 🚀 Node.js for bringing magic to the server.

I believe that every website should not only be functional but also a true work of art.

## 🎶 My Passions

Beyond coding, I pour my soul into music 🎵. I don't just listen; I play the guitar 🎸 and sing 🎤. The creativity of the arts inspires me and adds harmony to my life.
