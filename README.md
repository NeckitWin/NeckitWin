# 🚀 About Me
Hello! 👋 I'm Nikita. What if I told you that this is not real? All you see is code. ☕

## 💻 What I Do
I'm all about web development, where I merge code with art to create stunning digital experiences. My toolkit includes:

🌐 HTML for structuring content.
🎨 CSS for style and elegance.
💡 JavaScript for interactivity.
🚀 Node.js for server-side magic.
I believe every website should be a functional work of art.

## 🎶 My Passions
Besides coding, I'm into music 🎵. I strum the guitar 🎸 and belt out tunes 🎤. The arts inspire me and bring balance to my life.
